The main purpose of this tutorial is to get you familiar with GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). GIMP is a free open-source image editing program for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. It is a powerful image editing tool that can be used when more powerful options such as Photoshop are not available.   

In this tutorial we will cover three topics focused on getting started, covering editing basic tools, and a brief look at some advanced tools such as effects.

This tutorial is designed to be an extension of Module 3: Digital Images; specifically bitmap images, image formats, and compression. It is aimed towards those who are new or just getting started with GIMP,  although there is some information that even intermediate users might find helpful.
