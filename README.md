The main purpose of this tutorial is to introduce basic skills for working with GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). GIMP is a free open-source image editing program for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. It is a powerful image editing tool that can be used when more powerful options such as Photoshop are not available.  

This tutorial is designed to be an extension of Module 3: Digital Images by extending the topic of bitmap images. It is aimed towards those who are new or just getting started with GIMP and/or image editing software, although there is some information that even intermediate users might find helpful.

This tutorial will cover two topics:
1. **Getting started**  
    * Will cover installation of GIMP.    
2. **Basic editing tools**
    * This is where the bulk of the tutorial is centered on.   
    * It will introduce the most commonly used tools for basic image editing, including the different selection tools, paintbrush and pencil tools, the text tool, just to name a few.   
    * Will briefly cover saving and exporting images.
