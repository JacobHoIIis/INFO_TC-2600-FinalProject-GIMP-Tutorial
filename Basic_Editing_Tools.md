#### Layout and Tool Windows

In GIMP, there are three main windows/toolbars you will use.

The far left window, the ***Toolbox***, contains the main editing tools and their options.

The middle window contains 1. the editing canvas,

and 2. the main navbar.

The right window, ***Layers and Brushes***, contains image layers (beyond the scope of this tutorial, but important for advanced editing) in the upper half, and various types of brushes used for the Paintbrush and Pencil tools (discussed later in this tutorial) in the lower half.

#### Creating/Choosing a File to Edit   

With GIMP, you can create a new image file or edit an existing image.   

*To edit an existing file:*
1. Go to the navbar.
2. Select **File -> Open**
3. From here, you can navigate to the image you want to edit.
4. Select **Open**
5. Now the file is ready to be edited   

*To create a new file:*

1. Go to the navbar
2. Select **File -> New**
3. From here, you will get this window:

4. Choose the image width and height. **Templates** will also give you preset sizes for quick creation.
  * **Advanced Options** will give you more extensive options, but is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
5. Once the size is set, select **Ok**.   

At this point you should see a blank white image on the canvas. We can now begin editing.

#### Painting, Pencil, and Text Tools

1. Paintbrush
 * The paintbrush tool can be used like just like name implies.     
It will "paint" a stroke with blurred edges.

2. Pencil   
 * The pencil tool works the same way as the paintbrush tool.
   However, it will "draw" a stroke *without* blurred edges.
