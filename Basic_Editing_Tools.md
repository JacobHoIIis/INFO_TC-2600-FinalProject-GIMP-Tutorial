#### Layout and Tool Windows

In GIMP, there are three main windows/toolbars you will use.

The far left window, the ***Toolbox***, contains the main editing tools and their options.

and 2. the main navbar.

The right window, ***Layers and Brushes***, contains image layers (beyond the scope of this tutorial, but important for advanced editing) in the upper half, and various types of brushes used for the Paintbrush and Pencil tools (discussed later in this tutorial) in the lower half.
