The main purpose of this tutorial is to introduce basic skills for working with GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). GIMP is a free open-source image editing program for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. It is a powerful image editing tool that can be used when more powerful options such as Photoshop are not available.   

This tutorial will cover three topics:
1. **Getting started**  
    * Will cover installation and saving/exporting images.    
2. **Basic editing tools**
    * Will introduce the most commonly used tools for basic image editing, including the different selection tools, paintbrush and pencil tools, the text tool, and others.  
3. **Filters/Effects and Custom Fonts**
    * Will briefly cover more advanced editing tools such as the many default filters and effects built into GIMP, as well as color manipulation.

This tutorial is designed to be an extension of Module 3: Digital Images by extending the topic of bitmap images. It is aimed towards those who are new or just getting started with GIMP and/or image editing software,  although there is some information that even intermediate users might find helpful.
