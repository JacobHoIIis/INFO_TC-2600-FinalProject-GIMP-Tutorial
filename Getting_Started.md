# GIMP Tutorial - Getting Started
## Download, Installation, and Setup
---
#### Where to Download:

First, you need to download the latest version of GIMP.   
You can find the latest stable version [Here](https://gimp.org/downloads).

There are options for Windows, OSX, and Linux. It should automatically detect your operating system, and give you the correct download option.      
However, if it doesn't, download the one that corresponds to your operating system under ***Show downloads***.

**Note:** The following installation instructions were done on a computer running Windows 10 OS; *however, the process is essentially the same over all platforms.*

#### Installation:
Once GIMP has finished downloading, navigate to the GIMP installer and open it.   

Choose your language, and then select ***Ok***.

On the next screen, you can either install or customize your installation. For the purposes of this tutorial, select ***Install***, as the default installation will work just fine for the purposes of this tutorial.

Wait for the installation to finish, then close the installer by selecting ***Finish***.

At this point, you are ready to begin editing with GIMP.  

**Note:** If you want to customize options that you did not set during installation, they can be set later in GIMP's preferences under **Edit -> Preferences**
