### By Jacob Hollis
---
The main purpose of this tutorial is to get you familiar with GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). GIMP is a free open-source image editing program for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. It is a powerful image editing tool that can be used when more powerful options such as Photoshop are not available.   

In this tutorial we will cover three topics, focused on getting started, covering basic tools, and a brief look at some advanced tools.

This tutorial is aimed towards those who are new or just getting started with GIMP, although is some information that even intermediate users might find helpful.
